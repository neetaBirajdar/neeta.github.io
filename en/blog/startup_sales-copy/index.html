    <h2 id="-sales-the-lifeline-of-startups">ðŸš€ Sales: The Lifeline of Startups</h2>
<p><strong>Sales</strong> is not just importantâ€”it&rsquo;s <strong>mission-critical</strong> for the success of an early-stage startup. While there are many pillars that hold up a startup, Sales is the engine that drives growth and survival. There&rsquo;s a saying for startups: <strong>&ldquo;Do things that donâ€™t scale.&rdquo;</strong> And guess what? Sales is at the heart of this philosophy.</p>
<p>Coming from a tech background, diving into the <em>world of sales</em> was like stepping into an entirely new dimension. Itâ€™s fascinating to learn <em><strong>how sales worksâ€”how relationships are built, trust is earned, and deals are closed</strong></em>. For me, it was more than just a challenge; it was a journey of discovery.ðŸš€</p>
<p>As a <strong>founder</strong>, no one understands the problem you&rsquo;re solving or the solution you&rsquo;re building better than you do. That passion? That fire ðŸ”¥? Thatâ€™s your secret weapon in sales. Learning to channel it into meaningful conversations and making an impact has been a game-changer for me.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s not sugarcoat itâ€”talking to strangers isnâ€™t easy ðŸ˜‰. But thereâ€™s something deeply rewarding about stepping out of your comfort zone and seeing yourself grow in ways you never imagined. Huge respect to all the incredible salespeople who do this day in and day out, turning &ldquo;no&rdquo; into &ldquo;yes&rdquo; with resilience and grit. You are the unsung heroes of startups. ðŸ’ª</p>
<p>As a founder seeking your first customer, itâ€™s essential to grasp a few key principles before getting started. Here, Iâ€™ve compiled insights from various workshops and my personal experiences to guide you on this journey.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-gtm-go-to-market">What is GTM (Go-To-Market):</h2>
<p><strong>GTM (Go-To-Market)</strong> is a strategic plan that outlines how a company will introduce its product or service to the market, engage with customers, and achieve a competitive edge.</p>
<h3 id="key-components-of-a-gtm-strategy">Key Components of a GTM Strategy:</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Target Audience</strong>: Define the specific customer segments you want to reach.</li>
<li><strong>Value Proposition</strong>: Articulate how your product or service solves the customerâ€™s problem or meets their needs.</li>
<li><strong>Sales and Distribution Channels</strong>: Decide how the product will reach the customer (e.g., direct sales, online platforms, or partners).</li>
<li><strong>Marketing Plan</strong>: Develop a strategy to create awareness, generate interest, and drive adoption.</li>
<li><strong>Pricing and Positioning</strong>: Establish how the product is priced and positioned relative to competitors.</li>
<li><strong>Customer Journey</strong>: Map out the steps customers take from awareness to purchase and beyond.</li>
</ol>
<p>A strong GTM strategy ensures your product resonates with the target audience, reaches them effectively, and delivers measurable business outcomes.</p>
<h3 id="identify-early-stage-adopters">Identify Early stage adopters</h3>
<p>Early stage adopters are <strong>forgiving</strong> and they are open to <strong>try new things to solve</strong> their problems. If they like your solution, they are good source for <strong>word of mouth</strong> kind of attraction.</p>
<ul>
<li>Find your ECP (Emerging Customer Profile) as a early stage startup than a ICP(Ideal Customer Profile).</li>
<li>Focus on Selling the Value than product.</li>
<li>Focus on Problem-Solution-Fit than Product-Solution-Fit.</li>
<li>Increase the willingness to pay. Repeated-value-add brings the willingness to pay.
<img alt="html_report" src="/images/startup_sales_curve.png"></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lets-start-with-3-levels-of-pain">Lets start with 3 levels of PAIN?</h3>
<p>There are 3 levels of pains that your customer might have, you need to figure out who is having the most pain at the moment to understand who will be your early adopter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Minor Pain : <strong><em>Nice to have</em></strong> ðŸ¤”= Slightly time-consuming, workaround is working for now, job gets done somehow. It will approximately take you : <em>2-5 years to convert</em> these people into customers.</li>
<li>Aggravating : <strong><em>Inconvenience</em></strong> ðŸ˜¨= Notable inefficiency, workflows are slowed already, not at high alert yet. It will take <em>6-18 months to convert</em> these people into customer.</li>
<li>Pressing: <strong><em>Time to evacuate</em></strong> ðŸ¤¯= Urgent, business critical, losing business, in need for immediate resolution, disrupts day to day severely, causing loss of revenue, emergency to get it done asap. It will take <em>0-5 months to convert</em> into customers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Identify customers who are experiencing the highest level of pain and are in urgent need of a solution. They will be more willing to adopt your offering, even if its remotely resolves their problem.</p>
<h2 id="fvd-framework-or-triple-constraint">&ldquo;FVD Framework&rdquo; or &ldquo;Triple Constraint&rdquo;:</h2>
<p>It was interesting to see this concept of FVD where all are individual concepts but are so much relevant to each other.
Feasibility, viability, and desirability are three key aspects often considered in the context of product development, innovation, and business planning.These three elements help evaluate and shape the success potential of new ideas, products, or ventures:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Feasibility</em></strong>: This aspect focuses on whether it is technically and operationally possible to bring a product or idea to life. It assesses the resources, technology, skills, and infrastructure needed to develop and deliver the product. Feasibility considers whether the project can be executed within constraints like time and budget. It&rsquo;s essentially about determining if the project is achievable from a logistical and resource perspective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Viability</em></strong>: Viability assesses whether the project or business can sustain itself financially in the long term. It considers revenue potential, cost structures, and profitability. A viable project or business should be able to generate enough revenue to cover its costs and provide a return on investment. Viability is essential for ensuring the sustainability and economic soundness of the endeavor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Desirability</em></strong>: Desirability revolves around whether there is a genuine need or demand for the product or service in the market. It assesses whether the target audience or customers find the product valuable and are willing to use or pay for it. Desirability often involves market research, user feedback, and understanding customer preferences and pain points. It ensures that the product or service aligns with customer needs and desires.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Achieving alignment among these three aspects is crucial for the success of a product or business venture. If one of these aspects is lacking, it can significantly increase the risk of failure. Therefore, entrepreneurs and product developers often use the FVD Framework as a guide to make informed decisions and prioritize their efforts.</p>
<h2 id="3-most-important-principles-of-lean-startup">3 most important Principles of Lean Startup:</h2>
<ol>
<li><em>Simplicity</em>:
Sell -&gt; Build -&gt; Find Resource.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Sell: Sell before you build it to understand the need of product in market and interested payers. Always do a Smoke Test, to make sure.</li>
<li>Build: Build the team, start working on the product building and gather feedback to incorporate.</li>
<li>Find resource: Funding, bootstrap, early customers and team attraction.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p><em>Mapping and Modeling</em>:
Map and understand every assumption you have and make sure you have it well thought.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Feedback gathering and coachability</em>:
Ask -&gt; Give -&gt; Receive</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Feedbacks are to make you better, so always share with people around and get their thoughts on the idea, to understand if you are missing some aspects of that.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="method-to-start">Method to start:</h3>
<p>Donot know anything &ndash;&gt; <code>Secondary Research</code> &ndash;&gt; Updates, more questions &amp; clarifications &ndash;&gt; <code>Primary Research</code> &ndash;&gt; Updates &amp; questions &ndash;&gt; <code>Tests</code> &ndash;&gt; Updates &ndash;&gt; Know enough to Act.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: <br>
<em>Secondary Research</em>: This includes reading articles, posts, google search, reading papers, etc. <br>
<em>Primary Research</em>: This includes more of talking to people in that area, interviewing people and understanding the needs.</p>
<h2 id="lean-startup-canvas">Lean Startup Canvas:</h2>
<p>The Lean Startup Canvas is a strategic tool used by entrepreneurs and startups to plan and manage their businesses more effectively. It&rsquo;s a simplified version of the traditional business plan that focuses on key elements of a startup&rsquo;s business model. The Lean Startup Canvas typically includes the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Define the problem or pain point your product or service is addressing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Describe your solution to the problem and how it adds value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Key Metrics</strong>: Identify the key performance indicators (KPIs) you&rsquo;ll use to measure success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unique Value Proposition (UVP)</strong>: Clearly state what makes your solution unique and why customers should choose it over alternatives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Channels</strong>: Outline the distribution and marketing channels you&rsquo;ll use to reach your target audience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Customer Segments</strong>: Define your target customers and their characteristics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost Structure</strong>: List your major costs and expenses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Revenue Streams</strong>: Explain how you plan to generate revenue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unfair Advantage</strong>: Identify any advantages or barriers that make it difficult for competitors to replicate your business model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</strong>: Describe the minimal version of your product or service that you can launch to test your hypotheses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Early adopters</strong>: Customer you think will be your first customers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
